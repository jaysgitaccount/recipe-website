            <h2 class="subheader">Description</h2>
            <p>My mother's recipe for no-bake cheesecake. I've made this for many of my friends (and even some people who don't like me!) and they all enjoyed it so I assume it's good. Personally this recipe is a go-to for me because it's not labour or technique intensive, it's easy to make ahead of time, and the cake itself is incredibly light and delicate in a way that I find most cheesecakes to be lacking.</p>
            <p>The cake is made up of three layers: a slightly salty biscuit crust, a smooth lemon-flavoured cheese mixture, and a layer of canned peaches held in place with jelly. I usually arrange the peach slices into a rose shape because that's what I was taught to do, but you can freestyle with any fruit and arrangement.</p>
            <p>The brand of cream cheese matters! So far the standard Philadelphia cream cheese block hasn't failed me. Additionally, feel free to adjust the ingredient quantities to taste. Just make sure you have enough gelatine to set the cake.</p>

            <h2 class="subheader recipe">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="recipe">
                <li>12 McVite's Digestive Biscuits</li>
                <li>75g melted butter (add a pinch of salt if it's unsalted)</li>
                <li>250g block of Philadelphia Cream Cheese at room temperature</li>
                <li>113g sugar</li>
                <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
                <li>300 ml thickened cream (generic is fine)</li>
                <li>3 tsp gelatine powder for mid layer + 2tsp for top layer</li>
                <li>1 large can of sliced peaches</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="subheader recipe">Equipment used</h2>
            <ul class="recipe">
                <li>9-inch springform cake tin</li>
                <li>Aluminum foil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="subheader recipe">Method</h2>
            <h3 class="subheader recipe">Biscuit base</h3>
            <ol class="recipe">
                <li>Line your pan with foil: remove the springform base, place a sheet of foil into the tin, then replace the base and close the tin, pinching the foil. Press the foil into the sides and grease the surface of the pan. You don't <em>need</em> the foil, but not all springform tins are waterproof!</li>
                <li>Crush McVites biscuits (I use a pestle and mortar, any way is fine).</li>
                <li>Mix melted butter evenly into crumbs. If you used unsalted butter, you can opt to add a pinch of salt.</li>
                <li>Press firmly into cake tin with the bottom of a flat cup.</li>
                <li>Place in the fridge while making cheese mix.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="subheader recipe">Cheese layer</h3>
            <ol class="recipe">
                <li>Place cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice and thickened cream into a large bowl.</li>
                <li>Mix (by hand or mixer) until smooth.</li>
                <li>Pour onto biscuit base and chill for a few hours, until no longer wobbly.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="subheader recipe">Peach topping</h3>
            <ol class="recipe">
                <li>When base is firm enough to work on, get your canned fruit. You can slice them thinner if needed.</li>
                <li>Arrange fruit slices on top of the cake in your desired shape.</li>
                <li>Stir 2 tsp gelatine powder into 118ml room temp syrup (if using canned fruit) or water. Leave to bloom for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Microwave the gelatine mixture until heated through, but <em>not</em> too hot. Stir gelatine to dissolve again, then pour on top of peach slices.</li>
                <li>Chill until set, then it is ready to serve. Keeps for about 2 days before biscuit base gets soggy.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="subheader recipe">Notes</h3>
            <ul class="recipe">
                <li>This recipe uses gelatine, so it is <em>not</em> vegan friendly (probably not halal either). I haven't tried setting it with agar-agar or any alternatives.</li>
                <li>You can use any fruit as a topping (or even blended into the cheesecake), but make sure it's a gelatine-friendly fruit!</li>
            </ul>
