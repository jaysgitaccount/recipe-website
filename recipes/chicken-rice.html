<h1>Chicken Rice</h1>

<img src="" alt="">

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This recipe was given to me by a friend of mine. It is <em>not</em> Hainanese Chicken Rice, but rather a pared-down version of that dish that is quick and convenient to make for dinner. I make this a lot when I want to pretend I'm eating something special but I don't want to actually put in the work to make anything elaborate.
    <br>
    My favourite part of this dish is the sauce that you dip your chicken pieces into. It is addictively salty and has a great mouth feel. The soup is also highly customisable, so you can make it as hearty as you want.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 chicken drumsticks, room temp</li>
<li>2 stalks spring onion trimmed, 1/4 stalk finely chopped</li>
<li>2 slices of ginger for soup, 2 tsp minced ginger for sauce</li>
<li>1/4 cup finely chopped ginger and spring onion, mixed in a 1:1 ratio</li>
<li>1/4 cup non-fragrant cooking oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
<h3>Chicken and Soup</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Start cooking rice if you haven't already.</li>
    <li>Fill a large pot (big enough for all the chicken) with cold water and some salt.</li>
    <li>Trim the ends of spring onions, cut into large sections and add to pot.</li>
    <li>Turn on the heat and bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Once the water boils, turn off the heat and cover to let it cook the chicken nicely. It will be done in 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>When chicken is cooked, remove from the pot and set aside. Remove spring onion bits and discard.</li>
    <li>Add more salt, ginger, chopped spring onion and any other desired ingredients to the soup. Boil further for flavour. </li>
</ol>
<h3>Sauce</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Mix minced ginger and spring onion in a small heat-resistant bowl with 1.5 tsp salt.</li>
    <li>Heat up the oil over the stove. When a wooden chopstick dipped into the pan produces gentle but steady bubbles, it's at the right temperature.</li>
    <li>Carefully pour the hot oil over the ginger and spring onion to cook it briefly. Then mix and serve with rice, chicken and soup.</li>
</ol>
