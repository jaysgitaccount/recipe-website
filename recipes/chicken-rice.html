            <h2 class="subheader">Description</h2>
            <p>
                This recipe was given to me by a friend of mine. It is <em>not</em> Hainanese Chicken Rice, but rather a pared-down version of that dish that is quick and convenient to make for dinner. I make this a lot when I want to pretend I'm eating something special but I don't want to actually put in the work to make anything elaborate.
                <br>
                My favourite part of this dish is the sauce that you dip your chicken pieces into. It is addictively salty and has a great mouth feel. The soup is also highly customisable, so you can make it as hearty as you want.

            <h2 class="subheader recipe">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="recipe">
            <li>4 chicken drumsticks, room temp</li>
            <li>2 stalks spring onion trimmed, 1/4 stalk finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 slices of ginger for soup, 2 tsp minced ginger for sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely chopped ginger and spring onion, mixed in a 1:1 ratio</li>
            <li>1/4 cup non-fragrant cooking oil</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="subheader recipe">Method</h2>
            <h3 class="subheader recipe">Chicken and Soup</h3>
            <ol class="recipe">
                <li>Start cooking rice if you haven't already.</li>
                <li>Fill a large pot (big enough for all the chicken) with cold water and some salt.</li>
                <li>Trim the ends of spring onions, cut into large sections and add to pot.</li>
                <li>Turn on the heat and bring to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once the water boils, turn off the heat and cover to let it cook the chicken nicely. It will be done in 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>When chicken is cooked, remove from the pot and set aside. Remove spring onion bits and discard.</li>
                <li>Add more salt, ginger, chopped spring onion and any other desired ingredients to the soup. Boil further for flavour. </li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="subheader recipe">Sauce</h3>
            <ol class="recipe">
                <li>Mix minced ginger and spring onion in a small heat-resistant bowl with 1.5 tsp salt.</li>
                <li>Heat up the oil over the stove. When a wooden chopstick dipped into the pan produces gentle but steady bubbles, it's at the right temperature.</li>
                <li>Carefully pour the hot oil over the ginger and spring onion to cook it briefly. Then mix and serve with rice, chicken and soup.</li>
            </ol>
