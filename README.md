# recipe-website
This is the recipe website exercise from the Odin Project. First I will create a HTML-only website, which will be revisited and styled when the course covers CSS.

## My learnings
I learned how to:
- wrap tags using Emmet in VS Code.
- use multi-cursor to quickly and easily edit multiple lines of code individually.
